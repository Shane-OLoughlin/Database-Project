# Database-Project

Hours individually:
Shane: 10
Rajeev: 10

Hours together:
7

We split 1, and mostly worked 2 (Rajeev) and 3 (Shane) by ourselves.

For installing, configuring and running project: Install Eclipse, import database2 from Dr. Lu's GitHub using File -> Import, switch passwords in userDAO for user john if necessary, switch birthday of root in userDAO if necessary, make further changes if desired to make it run differently.
