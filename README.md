# Database-Project

Hours individually:
Shane: 10
Rajeev: 10

Hours together:
7

We split 1 (Rajeev did E-R model and Shane did the relational model), and mostly worked 2 (Rajeev, configured table for client, also typed README) and 3 (Shane, redirect to David Smith page on login, created tables) by ourselves. We spent some time getting the GitHub page up too.

For installing, configuring and running project:

Install Eclipse, download zip of Database-Project from our GitHub, extract into eclipse-workspace folder, use File -> Import   -> Project from Folder or Archive in Eclipse, configure Java Compiler and Project Facets if needed, switch passwords in userDAO for user john if necessary, to run: right click on jsp page and Run As -> Run on Server, make further changes if desired to make it run differently.
