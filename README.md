# Database-Project
---Part 1 beginning---
Hours individually:
Shane: 10
Rajeev: 10

Hours together:
7

We split 1 (Rajeev did E-R model and Shane did the relational model). We worked together on 2 (Rajeev: changed names of columns of working User table to reflect Project specifications, also typed Part 1 README) and worked together on 3, which Shane mostly implemented (Shane: redirect to David Smith page on login, created tables). We spent some time getting the GitHub page up too. Both recorded video for Part 1 on Rajeev's computer, and Rajeev made and then submitted final PDF for Part 1 from scratch. 

For installing, configuring and running project:

Install Eclipse, download zip of Database-Project from our GitHub, extract into eclipse-workspace folder, use File -> Import   -> Project from Folder or Archive in Eclipse, configure Java Compiler and Project Facets if needed, switch passwords in userDAO for user john if necessary, to run: right click on jsp page and Run As -> Run on Server, make further changes if desired to make it run differently.

Rajeev: 18

Hours together: 23

Rajeev: did Part 2 README, implemented working clientID for User table, implemented working Quote Request ID for Quote Requests table for David Smith, implemented time-window initializations for the Quote Reponse table in UserDAO.java, made changes to David Smith page to implement reject and response links for each quote, got reject button to partially work and respond button to partially work. Once all the tables were implemented, cleaned up data for all necessary tables to make everything coherent.  

Shane: I updated the database tables, listed all the tables on the client and David Smith views, and implemented all the responding functionalities.

Hours individually:
Shane: 8 
Rajeev: 2

Hours together: 17.5

Rajeev's contributions: Drew up plan and document for submission, gave comprehensive input for the implementation of six out of nine problems, made script for entire recording, thoroughly tested final GitHub files to see if they allowed full functionality and to determine ways around any bugs that might appear on the grader's end.

Shane's contributions: physically typed the code for the part 3 function lists, receiving comprehensive input from Rajeev for six problems, and doing remaining problems by himself. 

How to install, configure and run project: Install Eclipse, download zip of Database-Project from our GitHub, extract into eclipse-workspace folder, use File -> Import   -> Project from Folder or Archive in Eclipse, configure Java Compiler and Project Facets if needed, switch passwords in userDAO for user john if necessary, to run: right click on jsp page and Run As -> Run on Server, make further changes if desired to make it run differently. If error in loading root page from login.jsp, go to rootView.jsp and press Initialize the Database. Then login.jsp will work. Also, if you have trouble signing in to any one account, just enter credentials twice and it should work.
